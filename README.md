# Flutter Login
A basic Flutter demo app to showcase my abilities as a fullstack engineer. In this repository you'll find a very basic API server written in JavaScript on Node and a Flutter app that interacts with the login endpoint.

Disclaimer: Could I make the API server more robust and add some niceties to the app? Yes, and probably will. Currently the text inputs don't lose focus when clicking outside and the server will die if anything other then happy path is sent.

## Starting the Server
In order to run the API server for the app to work, you'll need to run `yarn server` from within the `/server` directory.
